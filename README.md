# frontend-neighborhood-map-project

This project is a neighborhood map of several theaters, within proximity of one another, in the city of San Francisco. I developed this map with the help of frameworks: knockout.js and bootstrap, as well as the third party API from Foursquare, sharing more of the theaters' information.

By opening index.html in your browser, you should be able to click on the markers on the map to find out more about the theaters, or click on any of the theaters in the list to see its location on the map, or simply type a theater's name into the search bar and find it on the map.

All the world's a stage and we are merely players, so play on, players!
